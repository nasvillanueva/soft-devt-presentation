## Container





### What we (or everybody) use

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

<br>

### Alternatives

- [CoreOS' rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt)
- [RedHat's OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/)
- etc...




## Why use it?

- No more "It works on my machine"
- Isolated
- Like a Virtual Machine (VM) but Better
- Less Setup
