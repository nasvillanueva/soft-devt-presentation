#### Continuous Integration

> Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice 
> that requires developers to integrate code into a shared 
> repository several times a day. Each check-in is then 
> verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect 
> problems early.

> In most definitions, continuous delivery refers to the 
> process of delivering software updates to users on a nearly 
> constant basis ... People tend to use these [Continuous 
> Delivery and Continuous Deployment] terms interchangeably.
